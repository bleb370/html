        Pizza In this Italian pizza recipe, we’ve gone super simple: tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and homemade
        pesto. The
        simplicity of the flavors is truly stunning. Add the pesto after baking the pizza for the freshest flavor and
        brightest
        color. Here are a few notes on the pesto topping: 1. Homemade pesto makes the brightest green color.

        Pizza We used a fresh dough for this one, picked up from our local grocer. To that we added cherry tomatoes
        (which are always
        available) in lieu of fresh Romas and allowed them to roast in a 500 degree oven. The results: An easy to make,
        homemade, colorful and mouthwatering pizza, ready to eat from start to finish in about 20 minutes. You can put
        this
        together for under $10; at that price you can even afford to pick a nice bottle of red to enjoy with this
        beauty.

        Pizza originated in Naples, Italy, as a humble dish for the working class and has evolved into a global
        favorite, with
        its roots tracing back to ancient flatbreads.

        Origins in Naples

        Pizza, as we know it today, began in the late 18th century in Naples, Italy. It was initially a simple flatbread
        topped
        with various ingredients, primarily consumed by the poor. The classic Neapolitan pizza, particularly the
        Margherita,
        features a thin crust topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, representing the colors of
        the
        Italian flag. This pizza was named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, who visited Naples in 1889 and was served
        this dish
        by the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito
